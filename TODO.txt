When adding an opt, remove any existing opt that collides with either short or long name.

When parse() is called
  If no option with name -h or --help exists, then add one with:
     opts.noArg("-h", "--help", "Show this message") { () => println(opts); exit(0) }
  also add
     var autoHelp = true  // Can be set to false to override above behavior
 
With: -t --type=ARG (tall, short)
   --type=other   => invalid arg
   --type other   => invalid arg
   -tother        => invalid arg (instead of ignoring arg)
   -t other       => invalid arg
   
With: -t --type=[ARG] (tall, short)
   --type=other   => invalid arg
   --type other   => invalid arg
   -tother        => invalid arg (instead of ignoring arg)
   -t other       => ignore arg and call func(None)
   
Need to fix error reporting for case where arg is not attached to the switch
(short or long).  We must append the arg in the error message. How do we know
when to do this?


Args that handle comma separated lists ???  Do we need this?  Might as well.
